# host_memory_utilization_prediction
Using deep learning algorithms on historical memory usage data, we will predict ”memory utilization of Host”.
This project focuses on developing a model to predict host memory usage,
anticipating memory exhaustion and related problems. Using deep learn-
ing algorithms on historical memory usage data, we will predict ”memory
utilization of Host”. By analyzing patterns and historical usage data, the
model will provide insights to optimize memory allocation dynamically. This
solution seeks to improve cost efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and
maximize computational efficiency and operational costs. Although machine
learning methods can accurately predict host utilization, they usually take
too much time. To avoid that, we apply a concise yet adaptive and powerful
model called long short-term memory (LSTM) to forecast memory utilization
of consecutive future time intervals using linear past intervals.
